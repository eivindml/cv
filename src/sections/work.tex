\cventry{2015--2017}{Ways AS}{Co-founder \& developer}{}{}{
In 2009 I co-founded Ways AS, a web and app development company in Norway, and helped it grow to five employees. I had varying responsebilities, from administrative tasks to project leader and iOS and web developer. With Ways I got the chance to work on large projects, and learn all the parts of making great products. Everything from running workshops, research, design, communcation, and how to develop products as a team.

\cventry{2009--}{Freelance developer}{}{}{}{
I have been doing freelance work since 2009. In 2016 I decided to go freelance full time. I consider myself a full stack developer with a focus on web and iOS/macOS/watchOS development. As a web developer I focus on clean, structured and maintainable code and strive for good push to deploy workflows to reduce points of failure, and to support continous deployment strategies. I have experience with different CMS' and frameworks, and love to learn the newest technologies. I follow the Apple eco-system closesly and iOS/macOS/watchOS development is a passion. I follow the the community closely and love to test out new apps and see how things are done and spot out trends. From this I can make apps the feels relevant and at home in the Apple eco-system.
