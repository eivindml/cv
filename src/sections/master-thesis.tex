\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Automatic hyphenation---a rule-based approach to hyphenation}}
\cvitem{Abstract}{
 Current systems for hyphenation is based on pattern recognicion, which doesn't map well onto the ruled-based Norwegian hyphenation approach. The hypothesis for this thesis is that it would be possible to achieve better hyphenation results, by implementing a word/language/lexical parser and with this information apply the hyphenation rules. The thesis tries to answer this problem, and also implements a rule based hyphenator in ruby. Supervisor was Dag Langmyhr. \href{https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/44768?show=full}{The thesis can be read here}.
