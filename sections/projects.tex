 Since 2011 I have worked with the (mainly Denmark based) creative group Bureau Detours, and part of their Norway/Oslo fraction. Detours is a group focusing on social environments in public spaces. Through Detours I have worked on creative/art projects at the small Island Utsira in a lighthouse, Kunsthall Grenland Porsgrunn and at the art festival Lunga in Seyðisfjörður, Island---where I created a pirate radio transmitter.
