 Automatic hyphenation is an important part of todays systems for typesetting. Unfortunately this does not happen without mistakes. And more, the systems does not give any control over the hyphenation rules to be applied. In the norwegian language, we have multiple rules for hyphenation, which can give rise to hyphenations in a word. It can be argued that these different points hyphenation is of different quality, and it is therefore desirable to have a greater control over this process when typsetting a text. In this thesis we look at the possibility of imlementing a rule-based approach to hyphenation, which should give a higher precision and increased control over the hyphenation process.
