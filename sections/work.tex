\cventry{2015--2017}{Ways AS}{Co-founder \& developer}{}{}{
 Co-founded the mobile app and web development company Ways AS in 2015. 
 , a company focusing on mobile app development and web development. This gave me a huge experience increase in administration and how to run a company and project management of larger projects spanning almost a year, including research, design, web/backend iOS and Android development and testing. As a developer I was mainly responsible for web related development, including Wordpress, node.js, server configuration and front-end development. I also completely designed, developed and tested one of our client apps during this period. This period was a huge learning curve and really valuable.
