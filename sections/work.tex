\cventry{2015--2017}{Ways AS}{Co-founder \& developer}{}{}{
In 2009 I co-founded Ways AS, a web and app development company in Norway, and helped it grow to 5 employees. I had varying responsebilities, from administrative tasks to project leader and iOS and web developer. With Ways I got the chance to work on big year-long projects, and learn all the parts of making great products. From client workshops and research, to design, interviews of involved external partners, payment solutions and iOS, Android and backend development.

\cventry{2009--}{Freelance developer}{}{}{}{
Since 2009 freelancing have mainly been my main source of income. I've worked in various trades, but a big part of it was technical installations and mounting at various exhibitions. During my studies I transitioned into working with web development. Now I mainly focus on iOS and macOS development, and some front-end and Node.js development. I also work on self-initated projects, and have multiple apps in the Apple App Store.
